Hey, I’m RUI, a self-taught engineer，\
ailurophile, AWS solution architect, cycling enthusiasts and serverless enthusiasts. \
I've worked with several technologies like React, Python, Golang, with 3+ years experience. \
In 2021, I developed two SaaS services using serverless, which led me to discover the possibilities of serverless architecture, and I would like to share the insights of serverless development here.
